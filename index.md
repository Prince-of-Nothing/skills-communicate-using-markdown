# I thought I had buried the memories of my past life, but how could human emotions be simply buried?
## If I see the the Way in the morning, dying in the evening is of no concern!

### Heavens above...
### Heavens above!!!
### Release your power to me!!!
#### What is life to someone who lived without a heart, so desperately clinging to it?
##### If there's a being that rightfully deserves blessings, isn't it the minimum duty to ensure they are not left in misery!

###### I will protect these precious people with my life.
###### Being able to protect, as my master’s last will says…. is a privilege.
